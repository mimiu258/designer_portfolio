            REAL Fast helps to reduce the unnecessary DMV office wait time by allowing people to digitally check-in from anywhere at anytime. This provides the ability for the user to make the best use of their time given that they now know exactly when they will be assisted at the DMV office and when the CA REAL ID card process will be completed.
        </p>
        <p class="note">* Real ID card will be required for US citizen in order to fly domestically or enter federal facilities. Deadline: 05/03/2023.

            People live busy lives, and they cannot tolerate spending an unknown amount of time at the DMV office. Moreover, the DMV website does not allow the user to make an appoitment for Read ID purpose. This inconvience discourages the user from getting the CA Real ID card as it requires an in-person visit to the DMV office after submitting all the documents online.

            <p>We conducted <strong>6 interviews</strong>, and our goal was:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                - To know if the user has gotten the Real ID yet.

                - To know what the user think about the process.

            <p>
                - To know their expectations.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-align: justify;">
                According to our interview, we found that the users were mostly
                concerned about the <strong>amount of time</strong> they spend at the DMV office and wait for the Real ID card to be sent.

    <h2>User Persona</h2>
    <p>After researching, we could learned more about the user’s needs. Our target users are the people who are strugelling with making an appointment for the Real ID purpose at the DMV office due to their busy schedule. In order to make it more specific, we have create a user personal to represent our target users.

    <p>Gina is a full-time employee with limited free time who needs an efficient way to obtain a CA REAL ID  since she must visit a DMV office to take the necessary steps in order to complete the CA REAL ID process. Gina wants the assurance that her wait time at the DMV is not too long so that it would not affect her personal time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How might we help the users like Gina to shorten the wait time at the DMV office so that they can better plan for their DMV visits?</strong>

                <p>- Allow user to choose the DMV office and join the waiting list digitally.</p>
                <p>- Use the QR code to  generate information through out the process.</p>

            We have conducted <strong>6 user tests</strong>, and all of the users have <strong>completed the tasks successfully</strong>. 
            What we would like to test:
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>- Can my user able to join the DMV waitlist online by using REAL Fast Check in feature? </p>
        <p>- Can my user successfully complete all the in-office tasks?</p>
        <p>- Does my user find it easy to keep track of his/her REAL ID progress until the physical card is received?</p>
       
        <h2>Iterating</h2>
           
            <p>The user testing ran pretty good, but there are somethings that needed to be improved since we have observed our users’  reaction while testing REAL Fast Mobile App and noticed that there were some pauses/ confusions duringthe test. </p>
            <br>
            <p>What we have learned from our user testing:</p>

   <!--conclusion-->

    <h3 class="phase">Conclusion</h3>
    <div id="storyboard">
        <p>At first, we wanted to build an app that quickly verifies the uploaded documents in order to help users to visit the DMV offices with confidence. However, we made an adjustment to build a solution that will cut down the wait time or the time spent at the DMV office instead because our user research demonstrated that the wait time they have to deal with at the DMV was the real issue when it comes to completing the necessary process for obtaining a CA REAL ID.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the future - we envision this app being implemented to other online services that DMV has to offer.  We also see our app being applied to other highly populated states as well to make sure that all states are standardized.
            Competitor Analysis - Yelp offers a reservation system, plus the check in feature which allows the users to stay engaged with their wait times. We wish did more research on their features to uncover some areas of improvement that can be added into our application.
